# **Hi, I'm Andreas**

A biologist with a speciality in ecology and evolution, dreaming of working with marine species such as sharks, rays, fish and marine mammals. I've gotten closer to that dream in the last couple of years, and are currently doing my masters at the University of Copenhagen in the field of population genetics working with Perch, a freshwater/brackish water fish. 

I am highly motivated to pursue a PHD in the field of population genetics working on marine species, and in that context, this blog will follow that jurney. Here i will post scientific blog posts about research questions i find interesting, toturials for starting out working with genetic data and an introduction to R for beginners, in Danish. 

So if any of this sounds just a tiny bit interesting, make sure to follow along! Beneath you will find my CV, as well as my way into the academic world. 

I hope you have a wonderfull day!
